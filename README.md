This repository contains code for creating a static graph and a temporal graph for a set of 800+ sensors detecting 2000+ lanes on three traffic parameters, speed, flow and occupancy, located along the I-15 highway in Nevada. The static graph is generated using a weighted adjacency list based on the distance between the sensors. The temporal graph, is created based on the traffic policies defined.
